## üåü **Features**
- **Two-Player Mode:** Compete with a friend using dedicated controls.
- **Smooth Paddle Movements:** Real-time response with speed limits.
- **Accurate Ball Physics:** Bounce angles based on paddle hit positions.
- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of scores, and the game announces the winner.
- **Customizable Winning Score:** Set the winning score (default is 10).
- **Game Over Screen:** Displays the winner when the game ends.
- **Lightweight Code:** Runs efficiently with no external dependencies beyond `pygame`.

## üéÆ **How to Play**

### **Controls**
- **Player 1 (Left Paddle):**
  - Move **Up:** `W`
  - Move **Down:** `S`
  
- **Player 2 (Right Paddle):**
  - Move **Up:** `Up Arrow`
  - Move **Down:** `Down Arrow`

### **Game Rules**
1. The ball bounces off the paddles and walls.
2. If a player misses the ball, the opponent scores a point.
3. The first player to reach the **winning score (default: 10)** wins the game.

## üèÉ **How to Run the Game**

### **Prerequisites**
Make sure Python and `pygame` are installed on your system.

- **Python Installation:** Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).  
- **Pygame Installation:** Install pygame using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install pygame
  ```

### **Steps to Run the Game**
1. **Clone the repository** or copy the code into a directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ping-pong-game.git
   cd ping-pong-game
   ```

2. **Run the game** using the following command:
   ```bash
   python ping_pong.py
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration Options**

You can customize the game behavior by tweaking the following variables inside the code:

| **Variable**      | **Description**                          | **Default Value** |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `WIDTH`           | Width of the game window                 | `800`             |
| `HEIGHT`          | Height of the game window                | `600`             |
| `PADDLE_WIDTH`    | Width of the paddles                     | `20`              |
| `PADDLE_HEIGHT`   | Height of the paddles                    | `100`             |
| `BALL_RADIUS`     | Radius of the ball                       | `10`              |
| `WINNING_SCORE`   | Score required to win the game           | `10`              |
| `FPS`             | Frames per second (controls speed)       | `60`              |

## üîÑ **How It Works**

1. **Ball Movement:**  
   - The ball starts in the center and moves randomly in either direction.
   - When the ball hits the top or bottom walls, it bounces back.

2. **Paddle Collisions:**  
   - If the ball collides with a paddle, it changes direction.
   - The angle of the bounce is determined by where the ball hits the paddle.

3. **Scoring System:**  
   - If the left paddle misses the ball, the right player scores a point.
   - If the right paddle misses the ball, the left player scores a point.

4. **Game Over:**  
   - The game announces the winner when one player reaches the winning score.

## üîß **Common Issues and Fixes**
1. **Issue:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pygame'`  
   **Solution:** Install pygame by running:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

2. **Issue:** Game window becomes unresponsive.  
   **Solution:** Make sure the game loop is running efficiently and not blocked by other operations. Close other applications if needed.

3. **Issue:** The ball moves too slowly or too quickly.  
   **Solution:** Adjust the `FPS` value or ball speed variables inside the code.

---

## üìà **Future Improvements**
- **Sound Effects:** Add sound effects for paddle hits and scoring.
- **Power-Ups:** Implement special items like speed boosts or larger paddles.
- **AI Player:** Add a single-player mode with an AI-controlled paddle.
- **Custom Themes:** Allow players to change the background and paddle colors.
